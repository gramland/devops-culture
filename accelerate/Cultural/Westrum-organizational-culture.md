# DevOps culture: Westrum organizational culture

According to research by __DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)__, organizational culture that is high-trust and emphasizes information flow is predictive of software delivery performance and organizational performance in technology. 

The idea that a __good culture that optimizes information flow is predictive of good outcomes__ is not a new idea; it is based on research by sociologist Dr. Ron Westrum. 

[Westrum's research](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/13/suppl_2/ii22) included human factors in system safety, particularly in the context of accidents in technological domains such as aviation and healthcare.

## Westrum's typology of organizational culture
Westrum had been researching human factors in system safety particularly in the context of accidents in technological 
domains that were highly complex and risky such as Aviation and Healthcare. 

In 1988 he developed a typology of organizational culture. 

  * **Pathological (power oriented)** 
  
  Organization are characterized by large amount of fear and threat. People often hold information or withhold it for political reason 
or distort to make themselves look better. 

  * **Bureaucratic (rule oriented)** 
  
  Organizations protect departments. Those in the departments want to maintain their "turf" insist on the rules and generally do things by the book - their book. 
  
  * **Generative (performance oriented)**
  
  Organizations focus on the mission. How do we accomplish our goal? Everything is subordinated to good performance to doing what 
we are supposed to do. 

In his research, he developed the following typology of organizational cultures.

| Pathological   | Bureaucratic	| Generative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Power oriented | Rule oriented | Performance oriented |
| Low cooperation | Modest cooperation | High cooperation |
| Messengers "shot" | Messengers neglected | Messengers trained |
| Responsibilities shirked | Narrow responsibilities | Risks are shared |
| Bridging discouraged | Bridging tolerated | Bridging encouraged |
| Failure leads to scapegoating | Failure leads to justice | Failure leads to inquiry |
| Novelty crushed | Novelty leads to problems | Novelty implemented |

Similar to Dr. Westrum's findings, DORA research shows that a high-trust, generative culture predicts software delivery and organizational performance in technology.

## How to implement organizational culture

DORA research shows that changing the way people work changes culture; this is echoed in the work of John Shook, who spoke of his experiences in transforming culture: **"The way to change culture is not to first change how people think, but instead to start by changing how people behave—what they do."** 

This is seen in the technical, lean, and product management capabilities they have researched that influence culture.

In addition, teams can identify helpful practices to create a generative culture that fosters information flow and trust by examining the 6 aspects of Westrum's model of organizational culture, focusing on those behaviors seen in the generative culture:

  * High cooperation.
  * Messengers are trained.
  * Risks are shared.
  * Bridging is encouraged.
  * Failure leads to inquiry.
  * Novelty is implemented.

Based on these aspects, here are some practices you can implement to improve your culture:

  * **High cooperation**
  
  Create cross-functional teams that include representatives from each functional area of the software delivery process (business analysts, developers, quality engineers, ops, security, and so on). This practice lets everyone share the responsibility for building, deploying, and maintaining a product. It's also important that there is good cooperation within the team.

  * **Train the messengers**
  
  This means __we want people to bring us bad news so we can make things better__. Hold blameless postmortems. By removing blame, you remove fear; and by removing fear, you enable teams to surface problems and solve them more effectively. Also create and foster an environment where it is safe to take smart risks and fail, so that anyone can surface problems at any time—even without the ceremony of a postmortem.

  * **Share risks**

  Along with this, encourage shared responsibilities. __Quality, availability, reliability and security are everyone's job__. One way to improve the quality of your services is to ensure that developers share responsibility for maintaining their code in production. The improvement in collaboration that comes from sharing responsibility inherently reduces risk: The more eyes on the software delivery process, the more you'll avoid errors in process or planning. Automation also reduces risk, and with the right tool choice, can enable collaboration.

  * **Encourage bridging** 
  
  __Break down silos__. In addition to creating cross-functional teams, techniques for breaking down silos include co-locating ops with the dev team; including ops in planning throughout the software delivery lifecycle; and implementing ChatOps. Another tip is to identify someone in the organization whose work you don't understand (or whose work frustrates you, like procurement) and invite them to coffee or lunch. Informal discussions help foster better communication, and you may understand why they do what they do—and you can come up with creative solutions together.

  * **Let failure lead to inquiry**

  Again, hold blameless postmortems. The response to failure shapes the culture of an organization. Blaming individuals for failures creates a negative culture. If instead, failures lead you to ask questions about what caused the failures and how you can keep them from happening again in the future, you've improved your technical system, your processes, and your culture.

  * **Implement novelty** 
  
  __Encourage experimentation__. Giving employees freedom to explore new ideas can lead to great outcomes. Some companies give engineers time each week for experimentation. Others host internal hack days or mini-conferences to share ideas and collaborate. Many new features and products began this way. When you release your employees from habitual pathways and repetitive tasks, they can generate enormous value for your organization. And remember that novelty isn't limited to new products and features. Also encourage and reward improvements in process and ideas that help foster collaboration.

### Common pitfalls of organizational culture

Organizational cultures with high information flow often encounter the following pitfalls:

  - Ignoring the importance of culture altogether, and treating technical work as a technology and process challenge only.
  - Focusing only on local team cultures, and not reaching out to also understand how team cultures interact with the broader organizational culture.
  - Not having enough support, or appropriate support, from leaders and managers for the necessary culture shift and transformation.
  - Ignoring or punishing bad news. It's better to understand that failures are inevitable in complex systems, and treat them as opportunities to improve and learn.
  - Not encouraging novelty. Admiral Grace Hopper, the famed computer science pioneer and inventor of the compiler, once said, "The most dangerous phrase in the language is ‘we've always done it this way.'" Allowing and encouraging teams to experiment and try new things will make work better.
  - By focusing on the six aspects of Westrum's typology, teams and organizations can work thoughtfully and meaningfully toward improving their culture.


## Information processing

In his work with these high risk, highly complex fields, Westrum noted that such a __culture influences the way information flows__ through an organization. Westrum provides __3 characteristics of good information__:

  1. It provides answers to the question that the receiver needs answer. 
  2. It is Timely. 
  3. It is presented in such a way that can be effectively used by the receiver. 
  
Culture enables information processing through 3 mechanisms:
  1. In organization with generative cultured people collaborate more effectively and that is a higher level of trust both 
across the organization and up and down the hierarchy. 
  2. Generative culture emphasized the mission, an emphasis that allows people involved to put aside their personal issues. 
  And also the departmental issues that are so evident in bureaucratic organizations. 
  3. Generative culture encourage a "level playing field" in which hierarchy plays less of a role. 

  - A good culture requires trust and cooperation between people across the organization. So it reflects the level of collaboration and Trust inside organization. 
  - Better organizational culture can indicate higher quality decision making. 
  - Teams with this cultural norms are likely to do a better job with their people since problems are more rapidly discovered and addressed.
  
 The way to change culture is not first change how people think but instead to start by changing how people behave.
