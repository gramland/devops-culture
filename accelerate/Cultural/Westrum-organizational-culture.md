# DevOps culture: Westrum organizational culture

According to research by __DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)__, organizational culture that is high-trust and emphasizes information flow is predictive of software delivery performance and organizational performance in technology. 

The idea that a good culture that optimizes information flow is predictive of good outcomes is not a new idea; it is based on research by sociologist Dr. Ron Westrum. 

[Westrum's research](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/13/suppl_2/ii22) included human factors in system safety, particularly in the context of accidents in technological domains such as aviation and healthcare.

In his work with these high risk, highly complex fields, Westrum noted that such a culture influences the way information flows through an organization. Westrum provides __3 characteristics of good information__:

  - It provides answers to the questions that the receiver needs answered.
  - It is timely.
  - It is presented in such a way that the receiver can use it effectively.
  
In his research, he developed the following typology of organizational cultures.

| Pathological   | Bureaucratic	| Generative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Power oriented | Rule oriented | Performance oriented |
| Low cooperation | Modest cooperation | High cooperation |
| Messengers "shot" | Messengers neglected | Messengers trained |
| Responsibilities shirked | Narrow responsibilities | Risks are shared |
| Bridging discouraged | Bridging tolerated | Bridging encouraged |
| Failure leads to scapegoating | Failure leads to justice | Failure leads to inquiry |
| Novelty crushed | Novelty leads to problems | Novelty implemented |

Similar to Dr. Westrum's findings, DORA research shows that a high-trust, generative culture predicts software delivery and organizational performance in technology.
