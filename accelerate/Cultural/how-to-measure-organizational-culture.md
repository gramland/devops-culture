# How to measure organizational culture

See [Westrum organizational culture](Westrum-organizational-culture.md)

Organizational culture is a perceptual measure, and therefore, best measured using survey methods. 
The Westrum survey measures, included here, are highly valid and reliable statistically.

  * On my team, information is actively sought.
  * Messengers are not punished when they deliver news of failures or other bad news.
  * On my team, responsibilities are shared.
  * On my team, cross-functional collaboration is encouraged and rewarded.
  * On my team, failure causes inquiry.
  * On my team, new ideas are welcomed.

Present these measures together—unlabeled and untitled—with responses ranging from 
Strongly Disagree (=1) to Neither Agree nor Disagree (=4) to Strongly Agree (=7). 

They are a latent construct, which means you can average their scores to provide a single score for your Westrum culture metric. 
If necessary, you can alter the items slightly to fit your context, but we recommend doing only minor changes in order to preserve the statistical properties.
