### 3 levels of organizational culture in organizations

Organizational culture can exist at 3 levels in organizations:
  1. Basic assumptions
  2. Values
  3. Artifacts

  - At the 1st level basic assumptions are formed over time as member of a group or organization makes sense of relationship events and activities. 
  - The 2nd level of organizational culture are values which are more visible to group members as this collective values and norms 
can be discussed and even debated by those who are aware of them. 
  - The 3rd level of organizational culture is the most visible and can be observed in artifacts. These artifacts can include written mission statements or creeds, technology, formal procedures or even heros and rituals. 

### Westrum's typology of organizational culture
Westrum had been researching human factors in system safety particularly in the context of accidents in technological 
domains that were highly complex and risky such as Aviation and Healthcare. 

In 1988 he developed a typology of organizational culture. 

  * **Pathological (power oriented)** 
  
  Organization are characterized by large amount of fear and threat. People often hold information or withhold it for political reason 
or distort to make themselves look better. 

  * **Bureaucratic (rule oriented)** 
  
  Organizations protect departments. Those in the departments want to maintain their "turf" insist on the rules and generally do things by the book - their book. 
  
  * **Generative (performance oriented)**
  
  Organizations focus on the mission. How do we accomplish our goal? Everything is subordinated to good performance to doing what 
we are supposed to do. 

### Information processing

Westrum provide 3 characteristics of good information: 

  1. It provides answers to the question that the receiver needs answer. 
  2. It is Timely. 
  3. It is presented in such a way that can be effectively used by the receiver. 
  
  
Culture enables information processing through 3 mechanisms:
  1. In organization with generative cultured people collaborate more effectively and that is a higher level of trust both 
across the organization and up and down the hierarchy. 
  2. Generative culture emphasized the mission, an emphasis that allows people involved to put aside their personal issues. 
  And also the departmental issues that are so evident in bureaucratic organizations. 
  3. Generative culture encourage a "level playing field" in which hierarchy plays less of a role. 

  - A good culture requires trust and cooperation between people across the organization. So it reflects the level of collaboration and Trust inside organization. 
  - Better organizational culture can indicate higher quality decision making. 
  - Teams with this cultural norms are likely to do a better job with their people since problems are more rapidly discovered and addressed.
  
 The way to change culture is not first change how people think but instead to start by changing how people behave.
