# Continuous delivery capabilities

Continuous delivery (CD) is a set of capabilities that enable us to get changes of all kind -features, configuration changes, bug fixes, experiments- into production or into the hands of users safely, quickly, sustainably.

The 8 Continuous delivery (CD) capabilitibities are:
* Use version control for all production artifacts
* Automate the deployment process
* Implement continuous integration (CI)
* Implement test automation
* Shift left on security
* Implement continuous delivery (CD)


In order to implement CD the following 3 foundations must be created:

* Comprehensive configuration management
* Continuous integration (CI)
* Continuous testing


## The 5 principles of Continuous delivery (CD)

  * **Build quality in**
  
  In continuous delivery we invest in building a culture supported by tools and people where we can detect any issues quickly so that they can be fixed straight away when they are cheap to detect and resolve. 

  * **Work in small batches**
  
  A key goal of continuous delivery is changing the economics of the software delivery process. So that cost of pushing out individual change is very low. By splitting work up into much smaller chunks that deliver measurable business outcomes quickly for a small part of our target market we get essential feedback on the work we are doing so that we can course correct. 
  
  * **Computers perform repetitive tasks people solve problems**
  
  Repetitive work that takes a long time such as regression testing and software deployments should be simplified and automated. Free up people for higher-value problem solving work as improving design and processes in response to feedback.
  
  * **Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement**
  
  High performers make improvement part of everybody's daily work.
  
  * **Everyone is responsible**
  
  A key objective for management is making the state of this system-level outcomes transparent, working with the rest of the organization to set measurable, achievable, time-bound goals for these outcomes, and then helping their teams work towards them. 


DORA found the teams that did well at continuous delivery achieve the following outcomes: 

  - Strong identification with the organization you work for 
  - Higher levels of software delivery performance (lead time, deploy frequency, time to restore service)
  - Lower change failure rates 
  - Generative performance-oriented culture. 
  
Investment in technology are also investments in people and these investments will make our technology process more sustainable. 

Continuous delivery helps team to achieve one of 12 principles of agile Manifesto "Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsor developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely". 

  - Lower levels of deployment pain 
  - Reduce team burnout
