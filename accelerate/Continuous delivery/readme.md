# Continuous delivery

Continuous delivery (CD) is a set of capabilities that enable us to get changes of all kind -features, configuration changes, bug fixes, experiments- into production or into the hands of users safely, quickly, sustainably.

Here the 5 principles of CD:

* Build quality in
* Work in small batches
* Computers perform repetitive tasks; people solve problems
* Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement
* Everyone is responsible

In order to implement CD the following 3 foundations must be created:

* Comprehensive configuration management
* Continuous integration (CI)
* Continuous testing

The 8 CD capabilitibities are:
* Use version control for all production artifacts
* Automate the deployment process
* Implement continuous integration (CI)
* Implement test automation
* Shift left on security
* Implement continuous delivery (CD)
