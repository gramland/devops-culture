# Shifting left on security 

The DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) found that when teams shift left on information security- that is, when they built it into the software delivery process instead of making it separate phase that happens downstream of development process- this positively impacts their ability to practice continuous delivery.
This, in turn, positively impacts delivery performance. 

What does shifting left entail?

 1. Security reviews are conducted for all major features and this review process is performing such a way that it doesn't slow down the development process. 
 2. Information security should be integrated into the entire software delivery lifecycle from development through operations. 
 This means infosec experts should contribute to the process of designing application attend and provide feedback on demonstration of the software and ensure that the security features are tested as part of the automated test suite. 
 
 Finally, we want to make it easy for developers to do the right thing when it comes to infosec. 
 This can be achieved by ensuring that there are easy to consume pre-approved libraries, package store, chains and processes available for developers and IT operations.
