# Architecture capabilities

Types of systems:
* Greenfield
* Systems of engagement
* Systems of record
* Custom software developed by another company
* Custom software developed in-house
* Packaged commercial off-the-shelf software
* Embedded software that runs on a manufactured hardware device
* Software with a user-installed component (including mobile apps)
* Non-mainframe software that runs on private server
* Mainframe software

Low performer are more likely to be working on mainframe or custom software developed by another company.
In all other cases there is no correlation with the performance.

The 2 architecture key capabilities are more impactful:

* Use a loosely coupled architecture
* Architect for empowered teams

What tools or technologies are used is irrelevant if the people that must use them hate using them, or if they don't achieve the outcomes and don't enable the generative culture behaviors.
What is important is enabling teams to make changes to their products or services without depending on other teams or systems.

Architects should focus on engineers and outcomes, not tools or technology. Teams should choose their own tools.
