# Architecture capabilities

## Impactful architecture key capabilities
The 2 architecture key capabilities more impactful are:

* Use a loosely coupled architecture
* Architect for empowered teams


### Use a loosely coupled architecture

If we achieve a loosely coupled well encapsulated architecture with an organizational structure to match, 2 important things happen:
   
   1. We can achieve better delivery performance increase in both Tempo and sustainability while reducing the burnout and the pain of deployment 
   2. We can substantially grow the size of our engineering organization and increase productivity linearly or better than linearly as we do so.

### Architect for empowered teams

What tools or technologies are used is irrelevant if the people that must use them hate using them, or if they don't achieve the outcomes and don't enable the generative culture behaviors.
What is important is enabling teams to make changes to their products or services without depending on other teams or systems.

Architects should focus on engineers and outcomes, not tools or technology. Teams should choose their own tools.

By focusing on the factors that predict a high delivery performance (a goal-oriented generative culture, a modular architecture, engineering practices that enable continuous delivery, and effective leadership) we can scale deployments per developer per day linearly or better, with the number of developers. This allows our business to move faster as we add more people, not slow down, as is more typically the case.Â 

## Types of systems

Types of systems identified by DORA:
* Greenfield
* Systems of engagement
* Systems of record
* Custom software developed by another company
* Custom software developed in-house
* Packaged commercial off-the-shelf software
* Embedded software that runs on a manufactured hardware device
* Software with a user-installed component (including mobile apps)
* Non-mainframe software that runs on private server
* Mainframe software

Low performer are more likely to be working on mainframe or custom software developed by another company.
In all other cases there is no correlation with the performance.
