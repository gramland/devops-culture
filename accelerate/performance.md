# Measuring productivity

Measuring productivity in terms of line of code has a long history in software.
Some companies even require developers to record the lines of code committed per week.
However in reality we would prefer a 10 line solution to a 1000 line solution to a problem.

Rewarding developers for writing lines of code leads to bloated software that incurs in higher maintenance cost and 
higher cost of change. Ideally we should reward developers for solving business problems with a minimum amount of code and it's even
better if we can solve the problem without writing code at all or deleting code or perhaps by a business process change.

A successful measure of performance should have two key characteristics:
  1. It should focus on global outcome to ensure teams aren't pitted against each other. 
      The classic example is rewarding developers for throughput and operations for stability. 
This is a key contributor to the "wall of confusion" in which development throws poor quality code over the wall to operations 
and the operations put in place painful change management process as a way to inhibit change.
  
  2. Measure should focus on outcomes not output. 
    It shouldn't reward people for putting in large amounts of busy work that doesn't actually help achieving organizational goal. 


## Lead time

Lead time is the time it takes to go from a customer making a request to the request being satisfied. 
The elevation of lead time as a metric is a key element of Lean theory.

## High performers vs low performes

When compared to low performers the high performers have: 
  - 46 times more frequent code of deployments 
  - 440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy 
  - 170 times faster mean time to recover from downtime 
  - 5 times slower change failure rate (1/5 as likely for a change to fail)
