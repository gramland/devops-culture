## What is DevOps?
__DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.__ The contraction of “Dev” and “Ops” refers to replacing siloed Development and Operations to create multidisciplinary teams that now work together with shared and efficient practices and tools. 

Essential DevOps practices include agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring of applications.

Arguably the DevOps movement is poorly named -ignoring functions such as testing, product management, information security.

The original intent in DevOps movement was -in part- to bring together developers and operations teams to create win-win solutions in the pursuit of system-level goals, rather than throwing work over the wall pointing fingers when things went wrong.
